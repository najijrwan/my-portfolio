      <section>
        <p>
          I'm a detail-oriented and growth-driven software engineer with a strong focus on building intuitive, responsive, and modern web applications.
          I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and continuously revisiting my work to improve structure, performance, and user experience.
          Whether it's frontend development, data handling, or user-centric design, I approach each problem with a mix of precision, creativity, and a deep respect for best practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          My portfolio reflects not just what I’ve built, but how I think—every interface, feature, and interaction is the result of intentional design and thoughtful engineering.
          I’m constantly expanding my skillset, exploring new technologies, and refining my workflow to produce high-quality, scalable solutions. 
          I believe in building with purpose, learning with discipline, and always pushing for that extra level of polish that turns good work into great work.
